# ATimeScreenInMinecraftBukkit
Im going to be a adult,for a brilliant birthday vedio for myself,I've made this timescreen,and recorded the time which 17:59:59 to 18:00:00,which means the clock of myself turn into 18.So the following are the usage of this jar and how it works

First,you can download this directory in eclipse or idea whatever,and make them into .jar,them push it in the plugin folder then you can gain a stick,click the stick you'll get a timescreen

Final file contains the necessary info of bukkit and it start the plugin
TimeScreen file contains each event and their corresponding code
Unit file record the units of seven screens and nine words'info
FlyFirework file makes firework released by 18ï¼š00
setTime makes screen show the time and setPoint makes screen show the points
Flip makes Timescreen works each seconds


Of course you can modify any file to meet your needs
